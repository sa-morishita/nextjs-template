# Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

Generate implementation tasks for feature: **$1** using vertical slice development approach

## Task: Generate Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

### Prerequisites & Context Loading
- If invoked with `-y` flag ($2 == "-y"): Auto-approve requirements and design in `spec.json`
- Otherwise: Stop if requirements/design missing or unapproved with message:
  "Run `/kiro:spec-requirements` and `/kiro:spec-design` first, or use `-y` flag to auto-approve"
- If tasks.md exists: Prompt [o]verwrite/[m]erge/[c]ancel

**Context Loading (Full Paths)**:
1. `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md` - Feature requirements (EARS format)
2. `.kiro/specs/$1/design.md` - Technical design document
3. `.kiro/steering/` - Project-wide guidelines and constraints:
   - **Core files (always load)**:
     - @.kiro/steering/product.md - Business context, product vision, user needs
     - @.kiro/steering/tech.md - Technology stack, frameworks, libraries
     - @.kiro/steering/structure.md - File organization, naming conventions, code patterns
   - **Custom steering files** (load all EXCEPT "Manual" mode in `AGENTS.md`):
     - Any additional `*.md` files in `.kiro/steering/` directory
   - (Task planning benefits from comprehensive context)
4. `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` - Existing tasks (only if merge mode)

### CRITICAL Task Numbering Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Sequential major task numbering & hierarchy limits**
- Major tasks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... (MUST increment sequentially)
- Sub-tasks: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2... (reset per major task)
- **Maximum 2 levels of hierarchy** (no 1.1.1 or deeper)

### Vertical Slice Development Principles

**üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: Each major task delivers a working, testable feature slice**

1. **Feature-First Approach**:
   - Each major task implements ONE complete user-facing feature
   - Include minimal DB, server logic, and UI in EVERY major task
   - Enable human testing after each major task completion
   - Prioritize visible progress over architectural perfection

2. **Task Structure Pattern** (for each feature):
   ```
   X. [Feature Name] - Complete vertical slice
   X.1 Database: Minimal schema for this feature only
   X.2 Backend: Server actions and data logic
   X.3 Frontend: Basic working UI components
   X.4 Integration: Wire everything together
   X.5 Manual testing checkpoint
   ```

3. **MVP-First Progression**:
   - Task 1: Absolute minimum viable feature (login, basic CRUD, etc.)
   - Task 2-N: Add features incrementally, each fully functional
   - Later tasks: Refine, optimize, add advanced features
   - Final tasks: Polish, error handling, edge cases

4. **Early Validation Focus**:
   - Database migrations must be runnable after EVERY task
   - Server actions must be functional and testable after creation
   - UI must show real data, not mocks, as early as possible
   - Include "manual testing checkpoint" sub-tasks

### Task Generation Rules

1. **Vertical Slice Structure**:
   - Start with foundational setup (auth, routing, basic layout)
   - Each subsequent task adds ONE complete feature
   - Features include: schema + server logic + UI + integration
   - Avoid "backend-only" or "frontend-only" major tasks

2. **Incremental Database Evolution**:
   - Add only tables/columns needed for current feature
   - Use migrations to evolve schema incrementally
   - Defer complex relationships until actually needed
   - Keep foreign keys simple in early iterations

3. **UI-First Visibility**:
   - Even if ugly, get UI working early
   - Use simple forms/tables before complex components  
   - Real data over mocks from the start
   - Basic styling is fine, polish comes later

4. **Natural language descriptions** (same as original):
   - Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure
   - Describe **what functionality to achieve**
   - Use **domain language**, not programming constructs

5. **Manual Testing Checkpoints**:
   - Explicit sub-task for human verification
   - Clear steps: what to test, expected results
   - Include both happy path and basic error cases

### Example Vertical Slice Structure

# Implementation Plan - Vertical Slice Approach

- [ ] 1. Foundation and minimal authentication
- [ ] 1.1 Set up project with core infrastructure
  - Initialize project with required stack
  - Configure basic routing and middleware
  - Set up development environment
  - Create minimal database connection
  - _Requirements: Infrastructure setup_

- [ ] 1.2 Create user authentication schema
  - Design users table with essential fields only
  - Add sessions/tokens table
  - Create initial migration
  - _Requirements: 7.1_

- [ ] 1.3 Build authentication server actions
  - Implement user registration server action
  - Create login action with session management
  - Add logout server action
  - Handle validation and error responses
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 1.4 Create minimal authentication UI
  - Build simple login form with server action
  - Add registration form component
  - Show logged-in state using server components
  - Handle server action responses and errors
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 1.5 Manual testing checkpoint
  - Test user registration flow
  - Verify login/logout works
  - Check session persistence
  - Confirm error messages display
  - _Requirements: Validate authentication works end-to-end_

- [ ] 2. Core feature: Task management basics
- [ ] 2.1 Add tasks schema
  - Create tasks table (id, title, user_id only)
  - Add foreign key to users
  - Run migration
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement task CRUD server actions
  - Create task server action
  - Implement server component for listing tasks
  - Update task server action
  - Delete task server action
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2.3 Build task management UI
  - Create task list component
  - Add new task form
  - Implement inline editing
  - Add delete buttons
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 2.4 Wire frontend to server actions
  - Connect forms to server actions
  - Handle loading states with useFormStatus
  - Show server action errors
  - Revalidate data after mutations
  - _Requirements: Integration_

- [ ] 2.5 Manual testing checkpoint
  - Create multiple tasks
  - Edit task titles
  - Delete tasks
  - Verify data persists on refresh
  - Test with multiple users
  - _Requirements: Validate task management_
```

### Requirements Coverage Check
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure ALL requirements from requirements.md are covered
- Track which requirements are partially vs fully implemented
- Later tasks can enhance features introduced earlier
- No requirement should be left without any implementation

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
‚ùå Building entire backend before any UI
‚ùå Creating all database tables upfront
‚ùå Mocking data for extended periods
‚ùå Separating backend and frontend into different major tasks
‚ùå Postponing integration until the end

### Document Generation
- Generate `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` using vertical slice approach
- **Language**: Use language from `spec.json.language` field, default to English
- Update `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json`:
  - Set `phase: "tasks-generated"`
  - Set approvals map exactly as:
    - `approvals.tasks = { "generated": true, "approved": false }`
  - Add `approach: "vertical-slice"` to metadata
  - Preserve existing metadata
  - Set `updated_at` to current ISO8601 timestamp

## INTERACTIVE APPROVAL IMPLEMENTED (Not included in document)

The following is for Claude Code conversation only - NOT for the generated document:

## Vertical Slice Benefits

This approach ensures:
- üöÄ Faster feedback loops with working features
- üîç Early detection of integration issues  
- üë§ Human-testable results after each major task
- üìà Visible progress throughout development
- üõ†Ô∏è Easier debugging with smaller change sets

## Next Phase: Incremental Implementation

After generating tasks.md, implementation proceeds iteratively:

**Each completed major task results in:**
- A deployable feature (even if minimal)
- Real user interactions possible
- Validated integration between all layers
- Confidence before moving to next feature

### Next Steps: Implementation
Once tasks are approved, start implementation:
```bash
/kiro:spec-impl $1          # Execute all pending tasks
/kiro:spec-impl $1 1        # Complete entire feature slice
/kiro:spec-impl $1 2.3      # Execute specific sub-task
```

**Implementation Tips**:
- Complete entire major tasks before moving to next
- Always run manual testing checkpoints
- Commit after each feature slice works
- Use `/clear` if needed, spec files persist

### Review Checklist (for user reference):
- [ ] Each major task delivers working functionality
- [ ] Manual testing checkpoints included
- [ ] Database evolves incrementally
- [ ] UI provides early feedback
- [ ] No "backend-only" major tasks
