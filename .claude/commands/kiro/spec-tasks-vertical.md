# Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

Generate implementation tasks for feature: **$1** using vertical slice development approach

## Task: Generate Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

### Prerequisites & Context Loading

- If invoked with `-y` flag ($2 == "-y"): Auto-approve requirements and design in `spec.json`
- Otherwise: Stop if requirements/design missing or unapproved with message:
  "Run `/kiro:spec-requirements` and `/kiro:spec-design` first, or use `-y` flag to auto-approve"
- If tasks.md exists: Prompt [o]verwrite/[m]erge/[c]ancel

**Context Loading (Full Paths)**:

1. `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md` - Feature requirements (EARS format)
2. `.kiro/specs/$1/design.md` - Technical design document
3. `.kiro/steering/` - Project-wide guidelines and constraints:
   - **Core files (always load)**:
     - @.kiro/steering/product.md - Business context, product vision, user needs
     - @.kiro/steering/tech.md - Technology stack, frameworks, libraries
     - @.kiro/steering/structure.md - File organization, naming conventions, code patterns
   - **Custom steering files** (load all EXCEPT "Manual" mode in `AGENTS.md`):
     - Any additional `*.md` files in `.kiro/steering/` directory
   - (Task planning benefits from comprehensive context)
4. `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` - Existing tasks (only if merge mode)

### CRITICAL Task Numbering Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Sequential major task numbering & hierarchy limits**

- Major tasks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... (MUST increment sequentially)
- Sub-tasks: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2... (reset per major task)
- **Maximum 2 levels of hierarchy** (no 1.1.1 or deeper)

### Vertical Slice Development Principles

**üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: Each major task delivers a working, testable feature slice**

1. **Feature-First Approach**:
   - Each major task implements ONE complete user-facing feature
   - Include minimal DB, server logic, and UI in EVERY major task
   - Enable human testing after each major task completion
   - Prioritize visible progress over architectural perfection

2. **Task Structure Pattern** (for each feature, enforce UI-first production-ready structure):

```
X. [Feature Name] - Complete vertical slice
X.1 UI Shell with Production Structure:
    - Create container/presentational components following Template Conformance Checklist
    - Implement client components with useHookFormAction + next-safe-action from the start
    - Create server action files with console.log stubs (production structure, mock implementation)
    - Use Zod schemas, constants, and production error handling patterns
    - Result: UI is production-ready, only server action internals are stubs

X.2 Backend Foundations:
    - Replace console.log stubs in server actions with minimal real logic
    - Add Better Auth integration, middleware, typed routes configuration
    - Implement usecase/service layer scaffolding
    - Keep database operations minimal (basic CRUD only)
    - Result: Server actions execute real authentication/data operations

X.3 Real Data Integration:
    - Complete usecase/domain/service layer implementation
    - Add comprehensive error handling and business logic validation
    - Implement cache invalidation and data synchronization
    - Result: Full production-quality backend with zero UI changes

X.4 Fit & Finish:
    - Add loading states, optimistic updates, error recovery
    - Implement comprehensive validation and edge case handling
    - Extract common utilities and refactor for maintainability
    - Result: Polished, production-ready feature slice

X.5 Manual testing checkpoint
```

**Key Principle**: UI code structure is production-ready from X.1; only server action **internals** evolve from stubs to full implementation.

2.1 **UI-First Production Structure Pattern**:

**Core Principle**: UI components match final production structure from Task X.1, avoiding refactoring in later tasks.

**Task X.1 Implementation:**

- ‚úÖ Full container/presentational separation (page ‚Üí container ‚Üí presentational)
- ‚úÖ Client components use `useHookFormAction` with next-safe-action
- ‚úÖ Server action files exist with production structure but stub implementation
- ‚úÖ Zod schemas, constants, error messages are production-ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server action logic is `console.log` + mock delay only

**Task X.2-X.3 Evolution:**

- ‚úÖ Replace server action stub internals with real implementation
- ‚úÖ Add usecase/domain/service layers behind server actions
- ‚ùå **Zero changes to UI component files**

**Example - Task X.1:**

```typescript
// lib/actions/feature.ts (production structure, stub implementation)
export const featureAction = actionClient
  .metadata({ actionName: "feature.action" })
  .inputSchema(featureSchema)
  .action(async ({ parsedInput }) => {
    console.log("üî® TODO: Implement in Task X.2", parsedInput);
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500));
    return { success: true }; // Mock response
  });

// _components/feature-form.tsx (production-ready from start)
const { form, action, handleSubmitWithAction } = useHookFormAction(
  featureAction, // stub action, but real integration
  zodResolver(featureSchema),
  {
    actionProps: {
      onSuccess: () => toast.success(MESSAGES.SUCCESS),
      onError: ({ error }) => toast.error(convertError(error)),
    },
  }
);
```

**Benefits:**

- No UI refactoring between tasks (structure correct from start)
- Clear backend evolution path (stubs ‚Üí real implementation)
- UI team can work independently with stub actions
- Tests work immediately with production UI structure

3. **MVP-First Progression with UI Validation**:

- Task 1: Absolute minimum viable feature (login, basic CRUD, etc.)
- Task 2-N: Add features incrementally, each delivering a visible UI slice before deep backend work
- Later tasks: Refine, optimize, add advanced features once UI behaviour is observable
- Final tasks: Polish, error handling, edge cases

4. **Early Validation Focus**:
   - Database migrations must be runnable after EVERY task
   - Server actions must be functional and testable after creation
   - UI structure is production-ready from Task X.1, only internals evolve
   - Include "manual testing checkpoint" sub-tasks

5. **Parallelization Analysis** (NEW):
   - **Common Foundation Phase**: Task 1 establishes shared infrastructure (auth, routing, schemas, utilities)
   - **Parallel Development Opportunities**: After foundation, analyze slice independence:
     - ‚úÖ **Can parallelize**: Independent features with no shared domain logic/components
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sequential recommended**: Features sharing utility functions, domain models, or complex state
   - **Dependency Markers**: Clearly mark tasks as:
     - `[Foundation]` - Must complete first (usually Task 1)
     - `[Independent]` - Can be developed in parallel after foundation
     - `[Depends on: X]` - Requires specific task completion
   - **Shared Code Strategy**: Document common code needs to avoid merge conflicts:
     - Extract shared utilities/types in foundation phase
     - Plan shared components separately if multiple slices need them
     - Prefer feature-local code initially, refactor to shared later

### Task Generation Rules

1. **Vertical Slice Structure**:
   - Start with foundational setup (auth, routing, basic layout)
   - Each subsequent task adds ONE complete feature
   - Features include: schema + server logic + UI + integration
   - Avoid "backend-only" or "frontend-only" major tasks

2. **Incremental Database Evolution**:
   - Add only tables/columns needed for current feature
   - Use migrations to evolve schema incrementally
   - Defer complex relationships until actually needed
   - Keep foreign keys simple in early iterations

3. **UI-First Visibility**:
   - Every major task must begin with a usable UI shell, even if backed by placeholder data
   - Use simple forms/tables before complex components
   - Replace mocks with live data in a dedicated sub-task (do not skip documenting the switch-over)
   - Basic styling is fine, polish comes later

4. **Natural language descriptions** (same as original):
   - Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure
   - Describe **what functionality to achieve**
   - Use **domain language**, not programming constructs

5. **Manual Testing Checkpoints**:
   - Explicit sub-task for human verification
   - Clear steps: what to test, expected results
   - Include both happy path and basic error cases

```

### Requirements Coverage Check

- **MANDATORY**: Ensure ALL requirements from requirements.md are covered
- Track which requirements are partially vs fully implemented
- Later tasks can enhance features introduced earlier
- No requirement should be left without any implementation

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Building entire backend before any UI
‚ùå Creating all database tables upfront
‚ùå Mocking data for extended periods
‚ùå Separating backend and frontend into different major tasks
‚ùå Postponing integration until the end

### Document Generation

- Generate `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` using vertical slice approach with parallelization analysis
- **REQUIRED SECTIONS**:
  1. **Parallelization Overview** (at the top):
     - List all major tasks with their dependency markers
     - Clearly identify which tasks can run in parallel
     - Document shared code dependencies
  2. **Task Groups** (separated by `---`):
     - Foundation tasks first
     - Independent tasks grouped together
     - Dependent tasks with clear prerequisite markers
- **Task Annotations**:
  - `[Foundation]` - Must complete sequentially first
  - `[Independent]` - Can be developed in parallel after foundation
  - `[Depends on: X, Y]` - Requires specific tasks
  - Add **Note** explaining parallelization possibility and shared code
- **Shared Code Documentation**:
  - Identify common utilities/types/components in foundation phase
  - Note which slices share domain models or complex state
  - Recommend extraction of shared code early to avoid conflicts
- **Language**: Use language from `spec.json.language` field, default to English
- Update `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json`:
  - Set `phase: "tasks-generated"`
  - Set approvals map exactly as:
    - `approvals.tasks = { "generated": true, "approved": false }`
  - Add `approach: "vertical-slice"` to metadata
  - Add `parallelization_analysis: true` to metadata
  - Preserve existing metadata
  - Set `updated_at` to current ISO8601 timestamp

## INTERACTIVE APPROVAL IMPLEMENTED (Not included in document)

The following is for Claude Code conversation only - NOT for the generated document:

## Vertical Slice Benefits

This approach ensures:

- üöÄ Faster feedback loops with working features
- üîç Early detection of integration issues
- üë§ Human-testable results after each major task
- üìà Visible progress throughout development
- üõ†Ô∏è Easier debugging with smaller change sets
- ‚ö° **Parallel development opportunities** after foundation phase
- üéØ Clear dependency tracking for efficient team coordination

## Parallelization Strategy

**Foundation Phase** (Sequential):

- Task 1 must be completed first
- Establishes shared infrastructure, utilities, and patterns
- Creates common types, auth helpers, and base components

**Independent Development** (Parallel):

- Tasks marked `[Independent]` can be developed simultaneously
- Each developer/AI can work on separate feature slices
- Minimal merge conflicts due to clear boundaries
- Faster overall delivery through concurrent work

**Dependency Management**:

- Tasks marked `[Depends on: X]` wait for prerequisites
- Shared code extracted early to avoid conflicts
- Feature-local code preferred initially, refactored to shared later

## Next Phase: Incremental Implementation

After generating tasks.md, implementation proceeds iteratively:

**Each completed major task results in:**

- A deployable feature (even if minimal)
- Real user interactions possible
- Validated integration between all layers
- Confidence before moving to next feature

**Parallel Development Workflow**:

1. Complete foundation task(s) first
2. Identify independent slices from parallelization overview
3. Assign/execute independent tasks concurrently
4. Merge and integrate as slices complete
5. Execute dependent tasks once prerequisites are met

### Next Steps: Implementation

Once tasks are approved, start implementation:

```bash
/kiro:spec-impl $1          # Execute all pending tasks
/kiro:spec-impl $1 1        # Complete entire feature slice
/kiro:spec-impl $1 2.3      # Execute specific sub-task
```

**Implementation Tips**:

- Complete entire major tasks before moving to next
- Always run manual testing checkpoints
- Commit after each feature slice works
- Use `/clear` if needed, spec files persist

### Review Checklist (for user reference):

- [ ] Each major task delivers working functionality
- [ ] Manual testing checkpoints included
- [ ] Database evolves incrementally
- [ ] UI provides early feedback
- [ ] No "backend-only" major tasks
