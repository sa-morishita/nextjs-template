# Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

Generate implementation tasks for feature: **$1** using vertical slice development approach

## Task: Generate Vertical Slice Implementation Tasks

### Prerequisites & Context Loading

- If invoked with `-y` flag ($2 == "-y"): Auto-approve requirements and design in `spec.json`
- Otherwise: Stop if requirements/design missing or unapproved with message:
  "Run `/kiro:spec-requirements` and `/kiro:spec-design` first, or use `-y` flag to auto-approve"
- If tasks.md exists: Prompt [o]verwrite/[m]erge/[c]ancel

**Context Loading (Full Paths)**:

1. `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md` - Feature requirements (EARS format)
2. `.kiro/specs/$1/design.md` - Technical design document
3. `.kiro/steering/` - Project-wide guidelines and constraints:
   - **Core files (always load)**:
     - @.kiro/steering/product.md - Business context, product vision, user needs
     - @.kiro/steering/tech.md - Technology stack, frameworks, libraries
     - @.kiro/steering/structure.md - File organization, naming conventions, code patterns
   - **Custom steering files** (load all EXCEPT "Manual" mode in `AGENTS.md`):
     - Any additional `*.md` files in `.kiro/steering/` directory
   - (Task planning benefits from comprehensive context)
4. `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` - Existing tasks (only if merge mode)

### CRITICAL Task Numbering Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Sequential major task numbering & hierarchy limits**

- Major tasks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... (MUST increment sequentially)
- Sub-tasks: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2... (reset per major task)
- **Maximum 2 levels of hierarchy** (no 1.1.1 or deeper)

### Vertical Slice Development Principles

**üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: Each major task delivers a working, testable feature slice**

1. **Feature-First Approach**:
   - Each major task implements ONE complete user-facing feature
   - Include minimal DB, server logic, and UI in EVERY major task
   - Enable human testing after each major task completion
   - Prioritize visible progress over architectural perfection

2. **Task Structure Pattern** (for each feature, enforce UI-first flow):

```
X. [Feature Name] - Complete vertical slice
X.1 Frontend Shell: Create visible UI with mocked or stubbed data so the flow can be exercised immediately
X.2 Backend Foundations: Add minimal schema and server stubs needed to support the UI (can return hard-coded values)
X.3 Real Data Integration: Replace stubs with actual data sources, wire UI to live server actions, remove temporary mocks
X.4 Fit & Finish: Extend behaviours (loading states, validation, cache invalidation) and tighten the UX for this slice
X.5 Manual testing checkpoint
```

3. **MVP-First Progression with UI Validation**:

- Task 1: Absolute minimum viable feature (login, basic CRUD, etc.)
- Task 2-N: Add features incrementally, each delivering a visible UI slice before deep backend work
- Later tasks: Refine, optimize, add advanced features once UI behaviour is observable
- Final tasks: Polish, error handling, edge cases

4. **Early Validation Focus**:
   - Database migrations must be runnable after EVERY task
   - Server actions must be functional and testable after creation
   - UI must show real data, not mocks, as early as possible
   - Include "manual testing checkpoint" sub-tasks

### Task Generation Rules

1. **Vertical Slice Structure**:
   - Start with foundational setup (auth, routing, basic layout)
   - Each subsequent task adds ONE complete feature
   - Features include: schema + server logic + UI + integration
   - Avoid "backend-only" or "frontend-only" major tasks

2. **Incremental Database Evolution**:
   - Add only tables/columns needed for current feature
   - Use migrations to evolve schema incrementally
   - Defer complex relationships until actually needed
   - Keep foreign keys simple in early iterations

3. **UI-First Visibility**:
   - Every major task must begin with a usable UI shell, even if backed by placeholder data
   - Use simple forms/tables before complex components
   - Replace mocks with live data in a dedicated sub-task (do not skip documenting the switch-over)
   - Basic styling is fine, polish comes later

4. **Natural language descriptions** (same as original):
   - Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure
   - Describe **what functionality to achieve**
   - Use **domain language**, not programming constructs

5. **Manual Testing Checkpoints**:
   - Explicit sub-task for human verification
   - Clear steps: what to test, expected results
   - Include both happy path and basic error cases

### Example Vertical Slice Structure

# Implementation Plan - Vertical Slice Approach

- [ ] 1. Foundation and minimal authentication
- [ ] 1.1 Prototype authentication UI with temporary client-side validation
  - Render login and sign-up forms with static handlers and mocked responses
  - Display simple success/error states without calling the server
  - _Requirements: Infrastructure setup_

- [ ] 1.2 Introduce authentication schema and lightweight server stubs
  - Add users table with essential fields only
  - Create server actions that return canned data to match the mocked UI
  - Keep migrations minimal so UI continues to function
  - _Requirements: 7.1_

- [ ] 1.3 Replace stubs with real authentication logic
  - Implement registration/login/logout actions backed by the database
  - Remove temporary client-side mocks and connect UI to live responses
  - Add error handling paths surfaced in the UI
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 1.4 Fit & finish
  - Introduce loading indicators, disabled states, and session awareness in the header
  - Ensure redirects and cache revalidation behave correctly
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 1.5 Manual testing checkpoint
  - Execute registration/login/logout via the UI
  - Confirm session persistence and error messaging end-to-end
  - _Requirements: Validate authentication works end-to-end_

- [ ] 2. Core feature: Task management basics
- [ ] 2.1 Sketch task dashboard UI with mocked data
  - Build task list and creation form components using in-memory data
  - Demonstrate optimistic updates visually without persistence
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2.2 Add minimal task schema and server stubs
  - Create tasks table (id, title, user_id only) and migration
  - Supply server action placeholders that echo fake responses consumed by the UI
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 2.3 Implement real task CRUD logic and wire up the UI
  - Replace stubbed actions with actual create/list/update/delete operations
  - Connect UI components to live data and remove temporary mocks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 2.4 Extend interactions and state handling
  - Add loading indicators, error toasts, and cache invalidation
  - Ensure multi-user isolation and optimistic update rollback
  - _Requirements: Integration_

- [ ] 2.5 Manual testing checkpoint
  - Create, edit, and delete tasks through the UI and verify persistence
  - Confirm behaviour across refreshes and concurrent sessions
  - _Requirements: Validate task management_
```

### Requirements Coverage Check

- **MANDATORY**: Ensure ALL requirements from requirements.md are covered
- Track which requirements are partially vs fully implemented
- Later tasks can enhance features introduced earlier
- No requirement should be left without any implementation

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Building entire backend before any UI
‚ùå Creating all database tables upfront
‚ùå Mocking data for extended periods
‚ùå Separating backend and frontend into different major tasks
‚ùå Postponing integration until the end

### Document Generation

- Generate `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` using vertical slice approach
- **Language**: Use language from `spec.json.language` field, default to English
- Update `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json`:
  - Set `phase: "tasks-generated"`
  - Set approvals map exactly as:
    - `approvals.tasks = { "generated": true, "approved": false }`
  - Add `approach: "vertical-slice"` to metadata
  - Preserve existing metadata
  - Set `updated_at` to current ISO8601 timestamp

## INTERACTIVE APPROVAL IMPLEMENTED (Not included in document)

The following is for Claude Code conversation only - NOT for the generated document:

## Vertical Slice Benefits

This approach ensures:

- üöÄ Faster feedback loops with working features
- üîç Early detection of integration issues
- üë§ Human-testable results after each major task
- üìà Visible progress throughout development
- üõ†Ô∏è Easier debugging with smaller change sets

## Next Phase: Incremental Implementation

After generating tasks.md, implementation proceeds iteratively:

**Each completed major task results in:**

- A deployable feature (even if minimal)
- Real user interactions possible
- Validated integration between all layers
- Confidence before moving to next feature

### Next Steps: Implementation

Once tasks are approved, start implementation:

```bash
/kiro:spec-impl $1          # Execute all pending tasks
/kiro:spec-impl $1 1        # Complete entire feature slice
/kiro:spec-impl $1 2.3      # Execute specific sub-task
```

**Implementation Tips**:

- Complete entire major tasks before moving to next
- Always run manual testing checkpoints
- Commit after each feature slice works
- Use `/clear` if needed, spec files persist

### Review Checklist (for user reference):

- [ ] Each major task delivers working functionality
- [ ] Manual testing checkpoints included
- [ ] Database evolves incrementally
- [ ] UI provides early feedback
- [ ] No "backend-only" major tasks
